# Skynet

## ðŸ”º What is Skynet

Skynet is a minimal command line interface for Large Language Models to control real robots. 

It provides an [MCP host](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/learn/architecture) that calls [Docker Model Runner](https://www.docker.com/products/model-runner/) to control robots, drones, and other devices that provide an [MCP server](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/learn/server-concepts) interface.

Skynet supports multiple step interactions for models that can perform such actions such as [Qwen 2.5 Instruct](https://hub.docker.com/r/ai/qwen2.5).

Written using [Osprey](https://github.com/k33g/osprey) on [bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)).

                Model->>Skynet: response
            end
            break no tool calls needed
                Skynet->>Human: display result

## ðŸ”º Using Skynet

You must have any robot MCP servers already running in order to run Skynet.

Then just run the `skynet.sh` command.

## ðŸ”º Installing Skynet

You can use Skynet with the [Docker Model Runner](https://www.docker.com/products/model-runner/) with any model that supports instructions.

[Qwen 2.5 Instruct](https://hub.docker.com/r/ai/qwen2.5) is known to work. Others may as well...

- jq - A lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor.
- awk - A domain-specific language designed for text processing.
- curl - A command-line tool for transferring data with URLs.
- bash - A Unix shell and command language.
- gum - A tool for creating interactive command-line applications.
- osprey - A lightweight Bash library for interacting with the DMR (Docker Model Runner) API.
